# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

This project analyzes 5.7M trip records from Chicago’s Cyclistic bike-share program to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** behave differently, and to propose strategies to convert casual riders into members.

> Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Google Colab  
> Timeline: Apr 2021 – Mar 2022  
> Dataset: Public Divvy Trip Data
